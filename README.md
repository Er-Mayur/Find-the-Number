Find the Number

To play the number guessing game, follow these steps:  

Start the Game: The game begins with an alert explaining that you need to guess a hidden number between 1 and 100 within 10 chances. Click "OK" to start.  

Enter Your Guess:  
Use the number buttons (0-9) to input your guess.  
Click the "ENTER" button to submit your guess.

Receive Feedback:  

If your guess is correct, you win the game. A message will appear, and you will be asked if you want to play again.  
If your guess is incorrect, you'll be told if the number is too high or too low.  
Each incorrect guess will reduce your number of lives. This will be displayed on the screen.  

Game Over:  
The game ends when you either guess the correct number or run out of lives.  
If you run out of lives, the correct number will be revealed, and you will be asked if you want to play again.  

Restart or Exit:  
Click the "Restart" button to play a new game with a different hidden number and 10 fresh chances.  
Click the "Exit" button to close the game.  
The goal is to guess the hidden number with as few attempts as possible.
